# Bootstrap-Portfolio

# Description
The goal for this project was to gain more experience in implementing Bootstrap framework for my portfolio. It allowed me to leverage their grid system and to structure the page easy without needing to make much CSS tweaks on my custom code. Also, using Bootstrap, it allowed me to experience a formal standard which can be used for building various sites.
